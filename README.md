The included Python code is used in my UIC Master's in Health Informatics research project to analyze a dataset for iatrogenic anemia within a general medicine inpatient population. The script evaluates patients on two different algorithms: the standard nursing blood loss algorithm and an algorithm derived by Lyon et al. It then classifies each outcome based on the modified WHO anemia classes as defined by Beutler & Waalen (2006).
